Shiny Ultra Brand New Accounting & Members Management.

README is TBD.

## Installation

This is Next.js project with modern Yarn as package manager.
Current Node.js LTS release is required.

# If you don't have Yarn v2 installed, run:
corepack enable
yarn set version stable

# Install deps
yarn install
```

**TODO:** configuration, SSO, all the stuff. Currently, reach to @imcatwhocode or @shatie for instructions.
